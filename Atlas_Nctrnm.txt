Hello NctrnmTRIBE,

I am absolutely 
thrilled to announce the release of 
the first single from GEMINI, the 
highly anticipated second part of my 
PIXEL trilogy. You can check out the 
single here: ["Atlas"] (atlas.nctrnm.com)

Following the 
amazing response to FLUX on November 
3, 2023, I am beyond excited to 
continue this incredible journey with 
GEMINI, set to launch on October 18, 
2024. ["Atlas"] (atlas.nctrnm.com) is a captivating 
downtempo IDM track that delves into 
the themes of self-discovery and 
resilience, providing comfort to those 
navigating through uncertain times. 

GEMINI signifies a fresh chapter in 
the PIXEL saga, delving deeper into 
the human experience and the quest for 
identity. ["Atlas"] (atlas.nctrnm.com) is just the 
beginning, and I am eagerly 
anticipating your experience of the 
entire narrative. 

Take a moment to 
listen to ["Atlas"] (atlas.nctrnm.com) right now and catch 
a glimpse of what's in store. Thank 
you for being a part of this 
remarkable creative journey. 

Warm regards, 
Nctrnm ðŸ’™ðŸ˜‰
